The SSH protocol is a secure and ubiquitous way of accessing remote services either using
a terminal or X forwarded GUI sessions. It is an extremely mature connection technology
which during the past 20 years have experienced only a few high profiled security vulnerabilities.
The recent inclusion of openssh into the default installation  of new windows versions
is a testament to its maturity, reliability and wide-spread acceptance as a connection protocol.
Furthermore, it is even believed to resist future
[quantum computing attacks](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html)
from version 9.0.
